# 6.2 Build a community

Building a healthy community of volunteers is vital to both an ethical and successful crowdsourced project. You will need a community of people interested in volunteering their time and energy to your project and you also need to maintain that community, interest, and trust over time. There are many different ways to build community around your project. By building a project on the Zooniverse platform, you are tapping into the millions of people who regularly use Zooniverse or receive the newsletter, which offers a significant amplification of your project in its first days. However, to build long-term engagement, you will want to craft a sustainable plan to reach new audiences and inspire returning volunteers (see section 9).


## 6.2.1 Develop a strategic engagement plan

Your first step will be to determine who may be interested in the content or methodology of your project. For example, does your project relate to specific interest groups, such as academic, political, or cultural organizations, local communities, or organizers? How might your project be a useful teaching tool that could appeal to teachers or students? Does your project appeal to a particular academic discipline or profession that may be tapped? Identify as many different potential audiences as you can think of. 

Next, determine your team’s capabilities for outreach to these groups, and create your [outreach plan](https://britishlibrary.pubpub.org/pub/supporting-participants#establish-an-outreach-plan-for-participants-and-communities). This includes both technical capacity and labor bandwidth. Possible outreach strategies could include traditional media, social media, listservs and newsletters, targeted outreach to interest groups, and live events. If you want teachers to incorporate your project into the classroom, you can design sample lesson plans. If you are located at an organization with a marketing or communications team, coordinate your plans with them. Many Zooniverse projects have received TV and newspaper coverage in local markets. 


## Case Study: Engaging the public

_Deciphering Secrets: Unlocking the Manuscripts of Medieval Spain_ brings medieval Spanish manuscripts online, and provides volunteers with the opportunity to learn paleography before participating in transcription.

Roger Martinez, Project Director:

> “Engaging the public in citizen science initiatives can be enhanced by identifying the natural affinity groups that may have personal, cultural, regional, thematic, and professional interests in your materials. Often we think about our materials in one dimensional terms where we are focused on a distinct perspective. For example, the Deciphering Secrets: Unlocking the Manuscripts of Medieval Spain project is specifically focused on uncovering cathedral and municipal manuscripts that pertain to Jewish, Christian, and Muslims relations. This niche theme can be marketed to a broader range of individuals and organizations. 

> First, U.S.-based genealogical societies that focus on LatinX populations are a prime candidate as the crowdsourced manuscripts offer the opportunity for individuals to find new clues about their surnames and places of origin. Similarly, cultural institutions that are dedicated to distinct Spanish religious populations, like the American Sephardi Federation, provide an opportunity for Sephardic Jews and their supporters to recover lost elements of their pre-1492 expulsion history. Regional and local historical groups, especially those intent on promoting cultural heritage knowledge, similarly offer the avenue of building cadres of crowd-sourcers tying their local American heritage to their ancestral origins. 

> Thematically, institutions and their members who are focused on issues like interreligious and interfaith initiatives, international collaboration, and comparative studies, are also ideal to reach out to with invitations to participate. 

> Lastly, there are professional organizations that might have peculiar interests in your distinct materials, such as graphic artists and typographers who are seeking unique and intriguing ways to inject historical features into their works. Think broadly about your materials to maximize opportunities to find new types of collaborators.”
