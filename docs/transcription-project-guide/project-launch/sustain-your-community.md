# 6.3 Sustain your community

Finding a community of volunteers is one thing; sustaining a community is very different. This section will provide guidance on how to support your project community in the long term.

## 6.3.1 Talk

Your primary point of contact with volunteers will be your project’s Talk boards. Talk is Zooniverse’s message-board space. Each project has its own Talk boards that act as a forum for volunteers to interact with one another as well as the research team. Talk is often one of the first places volunteers will go if they have questions about either your project or its content. 

It is important to dedicate time to regularly review questions and comments on Talk. During your initial launch rush, this may mean daily or even more frequent review. As volunteer participation levels out after its initial spike, you will get a sense for the rhythm of Talk and your volunteers’ posting frequency. It is often best to designate specific team members and/or specific times for engagement with volunteers on Talk boards. Ideally, you should aim to respond within a few days, if not sooner. If you plan to take breaks for holidays, etc., use the Announcement Banner to let your volunteers know it may take longer than usual for you to respond.


### 6.3.1.1 Technical questions

Volunteers will often pose questions about Workflows, Tasks, and Subject Sets on Talk. Be prepared to answer these questions succinctly and in jargon-free language as much as possible. You should do your best to respond to technical questions before reaching out to the Zooniverse team for help (we’re a small team, so it will take us longer to respond). If a lot of volunteers are struggling with technical issues, you might consider whether your Tutorial or Help text needs to be edited for clarity. Some issues may be solved by a volunteer updating their web browser, clearing their internet cache or cookies, or even just refreshing the page. 

If you are unable to resolve the issue, please send an email to [contact@zooniverse.org](contact@zooniverse.org) with the following information: 

* The project ID number
* A brief explanation of the problem
* Links to any relevant Talk threads



### 6.3.1.2 Discoveries

Talk is often a place where volunteers will post about things they find interesting in the Subject Sets they are working with. These are important ways to build interest and long-term engagement with your project and can even inspire new directions for your research. Sharing discoveries from Talk on social media or project blogs (with permission of the original post author) is a simple way to highlight volunteer effort as well as share interesting project content with the broader public. 



## 6.3.2 Project updates

Part of ethically engaging with your volunteers is sharing regular updates on the project progress, both in terms of how the transcription project is progressing and how the larger project is using the data produced by those same volunteers. However, you should think carefully about when and how you share project updates – the last thing you want is for volunteers to get discouraged by what seems like a lack of progress. 

Project updates can be shared on Zooniverse via Talk and through project-specific [newsletters](https://help.zooniverse.org/next-steps/newsletters/) (which are distinct from the Zooniverse-wide newsletter that announces new projects). These are emails that you can send to your registered volunteers after your project has launched. Newsletters should share your project progress and will often bring people back to your project. To send out a newsletter, email plain-text copy to [contact@zooniverse.org](contact@zooniverse.org) and we will send it out for you. 

You can also share your project updates outside of the Zooniverse platform, through social media, a project website, listserv, etc.
