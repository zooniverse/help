# 6.1 Prepare for launch

When you have finished implementing the changes from your beta test, you are ready to launch your project. As you head toward launch, you want to ensure that your project is prepped, you have an engagement strategy, and that you and your team are prepared for the human effort required. The first few days after launch are critical, as you will typically experience your highest number of volunteers in that time. However, as the initial rush levels out, you will also need a long-term engagement plan (see section 8) to build a lasting community of volunteers around your project.

To make sure that your project will run as smoothly as possible after launch, make sure that you have reviewed all of the content on your project and that you are happy with it. You should still expect issues to arise after launch, but careful pre-launch review will help ensure that you are prepared to fix anything that comes up later. 

Before you apply for launch, make sure you’ve done the following:

* Carry out a final 'check' of your project, including:
	* Reviewing all volunteer resources (Tutorial, Field Guide, etc.)
	* Testing your workflow from start to finish
	* Clicking on any links you have included in your project text, to make sure they work
* Upload your full dataset
* Plan your own PR efforts via social media, listservs, etc.
* Make a launch schedule: how often will you check Talk in the first few weeks? In the first month?

## 6.1.1 Apply for launch

To apply for launch, you will post on the private Talk board that the Zooniverse team set up during project review. At this point, the Zooniverse team will also carry out a final quick check of your project to ensure it is launch ready. 



## 6.1.2 Prepare your data

After the final review, you will upload the remaining Subject Set(s) you have for launch. Be sure to attach the appropriate Subject Set(s) to your Workflow(s). You can always upload additional Subject Set(s) later on, but you want to be sure you have plenty of data available at your initial launch so the early wave of volunteers does not run out of items to transcribe.


### 6.1.2.1 Visibility of metadata

If you want to include metadata with your Subject upload, you can do so via a Manifest. Instructions for how to upload data (with or without metadata) is available in section 2.


### 6.1.2.2 Retirement limits

When you first launch your project, keep an eye on your early Data Exports (or initial data in ALICE) to make sure that the quality of the output is meeting the expectations set via your beta testing results. If it isn’t, you may need to make additional adjustments to your project Tutorial, Help text, or even your Workflow. 


## 6.1.3 New project announcements

New projects are announced to the Zooniverse community via an email newsletter, typically sent out on Tuesdays, which reaches hundreds of thousands of people. This provides a large surge of volunteers at the beginning of a project, known as the Launch Rush. Managing this initial surge may require a significant amount of time in the first days or weeks after launch. Not only will you need to be prepared to answer questions from volunteers, but you should expect some issues to surface and be prepared to fix them quickly.

When you apply for launch, you will submit copy about your project for the launch newsletter. You will submit this via the private Talk board the Zooniverse team set up during beta. Click here for a separate guide to [writing an amazing newsletter](https://help.zooniverse.org/best-practices/2-launch-rush/). In short, be short. Also, be personal, clearly describe the project and its goals, and include links to associated sites (social media, other web homes of your project, etc.). [Example Newsletters](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xB0nNPzwwzNgCwm0_ZufIy-0I6HX3OG2YHkVZ-oBQCo/edit)

You may also choose to do a ‘soft launch,’ in which your project is set to ‘Approved’ and listed at zooniverse.org/projects without sending out a newsletter. This can give you time to work out any kinks in your project management infrastructure, while still leaving a public announcement as an open possibility for the future. If you are interested in a soft launch, be sure to mention this to the Zooniverse team member carrying out your internal project review. 



## 6.1.4 Prepare your team

Before you launch, it is important to think and discuss how people’s time and energies will be divided up both before and during the initial Launch Rush as well as in the long term. 

If you are working on a team, take some time to discuss the division of duties: Who will be responsible for checking Talk boards? When will they be monitoring and responding to questions and comments? Who is in charge of keeping an eye on your stats and early results to spot any potential problems? After the Launch Rush, how will these roles change? 

If you are working alone, try to plan out the time you will spend on monitoring your project during and after launch. How will you balance this work with your other commitments? Is this amount of effort realistic and sustainable? If not, you may want to consider delaying your launch until you can find some additional team members to work on your project. For both large and small teams you may find it useful to schedule regular time during the week to check on Talk, engage with your volunteers, and follow up on any technical issues that have arisen.
