# 3.2 Designing Workflows for the data output you want

This section contains information on the relationship between your desired project output and the process of designing your project Workflow(s).

## 3.2.1 Creating a plan for use

The Zooniverse Project Builder provides creators with significant flexibility in how they ask volunteers to identify information (or data) on an image. There are often several ways to organize the collection of the information you want. You should familiarize yourself with the different Tools in the Project Builder by reviewing [existing projects](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects) and experiencing them as a volunteer. Experiment with these Tools in the Project Builder to see how different Tools work with your images. 

As a project creator you should be familiar with the text you are asking volunteers to transcribe. Content drives Workflow design, so even if discoverability is a goal of your project, you should put in the effort beforehand to look through the materials to develop a general understanding of what your dataset contains. For example, if you are transcribing letters you may want to have volunteers separately identify text that is dates, names, or addresses, so that this information can be easily identified. 

We strongly recommend that before beginning to create Tasks and Workflows in the Project Builder you: 

1. Identify the data that you want to produce at the end of the project.
1. Identify Tasks in the Project Builder that volunteers can use to provide this information. At this stage, it is extremely helpful to identify [existing projects](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects) that have similar Tasks and Workflows to the ones you want to use.
1. Outline the Tasks and Workflow on paper or in software that allows you to sketch the sequential flow between Tasks. Consider whether Tasks might need to be repeated to collect multiple examples of the same type of information. 
1. Practice the Workflow with your data and consider whether it actually produces the data you identified as your ideal output. Request a Data Export from your test Workflows to confirm you are able to get what you need.
1. Consider what information can be identified by programmatic post-processing of the data. For example, instead of asking volunteers to identify dates, names and addresses in letters you might be able to programmatically identify these through their content. Dates are generally recognizable as a string of numbers, or contain numbers and words that do not appear in other contexts. Dates, and names and addresses of senders and recipients may also appear in distinct locations on a letter that can be identified via the coordinate locations of the text. 



## 3.2.2 Balancing the volunteer experience with prioritization of data quality

When designing Tasks and Workflows:

* Try to see the material from the perspective of someone inexperienced but eager to learn. As an expert you may have identified explicit or implicit structure in the text that you wish to have represented in your transcriptions. However, volunteers will not necessarily know the structures you wish to extract. The Tasks and Workflows you design should guide volunteers through the transcription process.

* Consider how often volunteers will encounter a particular type of text. A situation that volunteers may encounter in 1 of every 50 images is relatively rare, but worthy of consideration in your design. Tasks, Task options, and Workflows to address situations that volunteers encounter once in 1,000 images may compromise the volunteer experience by asking volunteers to perform a lot of additional work for little apparent reward.


Well-designed Tasks and Workflows can help volunteers navigate a large amount of complex text and transcribe it into a format that supports your research needs. However, even with well-designed Workflows you should remember that volunteers have limited time. Long Workflows are more likely to be left incomplete by volunteers. If your material can be divided into several shorter, distinct Workflows you may be able to reduce the amount of incomplete transcriptions submitted. 

Workflow design is also an ethical consideration (for more on this, see section 4.1.1). Putting in additional effort during the design stage can result in a better experience for volunteers once the project has launched. When you design Workflows with humans in mind, you communicate that you are respectful of the effort volunteers are donating to your project.
