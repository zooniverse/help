# 3.3 How to design a Workflow

## 3.3.1 Working from your content

The Zooniverse Project Builder includes several Task types that can be presented to volunteers to capture textual information. The Tasks that are frequently used in crowdsourced transcription projects are:

* Question Tasks
* Dropdown Tasks
* Transcription Tasks


### 3.3.1.1 Question Tasks

The main part of the page is a handwritten journal entry, with each line of text underlined in blue, representing the transcriptions that have already been performed on the image. On the right is a question task. The question reads: ‘What is the letter about? Choose a few keywords’ Below is a list of 14 options for users to select, including ‘health/illness/death,’ ‘travel,’ and ‘slavery/abolition/colonialism.’ Here, the user has selected ‘Quakerism/religion’ and ‘family and friends’ to describe the content of the image.](/img/transcription-images/3-3-1-1_cwq_classify.png)](/img/transcription-images/3-3-1-1_cwq_classify.png)

Question Tasks present users with a question and a set of predefined answers. The minimal number of answers to present is two—if there was only one option, you would know the answer already. We recommend that you try to avoid giving users too many options (less than 6 is ideal), though there are situations where this may be required, especially for ‘select all that apply’ questions (the screenshot above is a good example). The default behavior is to only let volunteers choose a single response—if you want volunteers to select all that apply, be sure to choose ‘allow multiple.’ 

You can use Question Tasks to create different paths through a Workflow depending upon a volunteer’s response. For example, if you are transcribing manuscript material which occasionally has pictures, you may ask volunteers a yes/no question about whether a picture appears on the page. If their response is ‘Yes,’ you may ask a follow-up question about the content of the picture. This branching structure hides irrelevant Tasks from volunteers.

### 3.3.1.2 Dropdown Tasks

[![A screenshot of a zooniverse transcription project utilizing several dropdown tasks. The project is titled ‘Shadows on Stone: Identifying Sing Sing’s Incarcerated’. The main part of the page is a handwritten prison admission register. On the right is a series of questions with a dropdown menu beneath. The top question reads “Sentenced (month)” and the bottom reads “Sentenced (day)”. The dropdown below the ‘day’ option includes a series of numbers representing days of the calendar month. Numbers 7 through 11 are displayed in the example. Here, the user has selected ‘11’ as the day of sentencing, according to the displayed admission register.](/img/transcription-images/3-3-1-2_sos_dropdown.png)](/img/transcription-images/3-3-1-2_sos_dropdown.png)

Dropdown Tasks allow volunteers to efficiently enter standardized text entries. For example, you may have material with a limited list of place names or personal names that occur within the material. From your knowledge of the material you can define a list of pre-specified options that volunteers can select from. Dropdown menus are an efficient way of controlling the entry of elements such as dates for which you want to limit the values that may be selected. For example, if you are transcribing letters from a restricted time period the range of years for which you will accept a letter being written may be limited. Dropdown Tasks constrain users to these values, and potentially lead to less error.


### 3.3.1.3 Transcription Tasks

Below is the journal with lines of handwritten text extending past the image. 4 of these lines are underlined, and one is currently selected. There is a popup box with a space to transcribe the selected line, as well as a suggested transcription that a previous user has already submitted. To the right is a panel with two tabs - The unselected one reads ‘Tutorial’. The selected Tab reads ‘Task’ and has instructions for how to complete the transcription task.](/img/transcription-images/3-3-1-3_pc_ttask.png)](/img/transcription-images/3-3-1-3_pc_ttask.png)

The Transcription Task is used to allow volunteers to collaboratively mark (underline) and transcribe lines of text. The results of this Task type include positional data as well as the transcription itself. This allows the research team to not only process the transcribed text, but also its location relative to other lines of text. For example, volunteers presented with a page from a journal can transcribe each line of that journal and the research team will be able to see that they are sequentially located on the page. 

Once a line has been transcribed, it will persist on the image, meaning that other volunteers will see it when they encounter that Subject. The transcription can then be reviewed by other volunteers, who will have the option to either select it from a dropdown menu—indicating that they agree with the initial transcription—or input a new transcription either by selecting and editing the previous transcription or typing an entirely new one. Once the text has been agreed upon by the set number of volunteers (see Retirement Limits in section 6) the drawn line will turn gray, indicating it has reached consensus and no longer needs additional review. No additional transcriptions may be submitted for a line once it has turned gray.

This is the most common Task type used in transcription projects. Projects featuring this Task will also be able to use the Aggregate Line Inspector and Collaborative Editor ([ALICE](https://alice.zooniverse.org/about)) to inspect and edit crowdsourced transcriptions after they have reached their retirement limit.
