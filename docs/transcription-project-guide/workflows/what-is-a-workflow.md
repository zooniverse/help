# 3.1 What is a Workflow?

Volunteers on Zooniverse projects contribute to data creation by examining a piece of media and performing activities that systematically identify features of the media. For transcription projects, the media is an image of text, typically handwritten, which cannot be read by a computer.  

You will ask volunteers examining your images to do one or several small things when examining each image. As well as transcribing the text, these might include answering questions about content on the page. Each of the actions volunteers perform when examining an image (or more generally, any other type of media) are known as a Task. Tasks are then connected in a logical sequence to create a Workflow. 

Definitions: 
**Task:** Any action a volunteer performs when examining a Subject. 

**Workflow:** This is a series of Tasks that a volunteer is asked to complete when presented with data in a Zooniverse project. This can be one Task or multiple Tasks, depending on the project.

See [glossary](https://help.zooniverse.org/getting-started/glossary/) for further elaboration on definitions

Effective Zooniverse projects consider the following principles in designing Tasks and Workflows:
* Tasks are simple and can be understood with minimal guidance. 
* The successful completion of a single Task by a volunteer contributes useful data even if the volunteer submits their Classification without completing the entire Workflow.
* Tasks are connected in such a way that nearly all relevant information a volunteer might encounter can be Classified for the research team.
* The collection of complex or extensive data from a single Subject can be addressed by developing multiple Workflows.
