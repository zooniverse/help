# 5.2 Beta: step by step

If you want your project to launch publicly, you must go through the review process. A public launch means that 1) we will send out a launch newsletter to our full volunteer community; and 2) your project will be marked as an ‘official’ Zooniverse project and listed at zooniverse.org/projects. If you do not want to launch publicly, you do not have to apply for beta review. Just build a project, set it to public, and send out your URL to your audiences. Please note that choosing to run a private project (and therefore skipping beta review) may limit our ability to assist you in later project stages – beta testing is a great way to catch issues with your project early on, while they are still easy to change.

## 5.2.1 Beta checklist

When you are ready for beta review, go through the checklist found in the Visibility tab of the Project Builder. At this stage, your project should be ready for volunteers to use – don’t submit something for beta testing that is unfinished, or that you wouldn’t send to the public. 


## 5.2.2 Internal review

When you initially apply for review, your project will first be reviewed by a member of the Zooniverse team. The team member will deliver their feedback using our standard [internal review form](https://docs.google.com/document/d/12l15ZDGrhWuWc1Nwy-v7sJeJb3JSjZNCqO_oCo_MluM/edit?usp=sharing). Once they have finished their review, the team member will write to you via a Talk post on a private (Team + Zooniverse) board they set up as part of the internal review process. **Make sure you are signed up to receive Talk emails for your project, or you may miss this step.** Once you have read the feedback, you can respond to the reviewer via the review form. Note that there is also a section for you to fill out, too. 


## 5.2.3 Beta review

After you have passed the internal review, it is time to schedule the beta review. Every Tuesday we send projects to the Zooniverse beta participant community for review. The max we send out on any given Tuesday is 3 projects. Your internal reviewer will tell you the next available slot and give you the opportunity to delay if needed. Beta lasts for about 1 week, and you will receive a link to your feedback via your private Talk board. Once the beta test is over, it is your responsibility to review your feedback and make any necessary changes.

As you prepare for beta, be sure to look at an example of the [Feedback Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd21yl-dmWFEF78cwMiatfOBxMXSZoPR8E_tMJZZEUdkYtpcw/viewform) we will send to our beta testers.
