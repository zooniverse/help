# 5.1 What is beta testing for?

Testing your project and making iterative changes based on feedback from others is vital to a successful crowdsourced transcription project. By soliciting and reviewing feedback on your project’s Workflow, interface, and Subject Sets, you will ensure that volunteers from diverse backgrounds and levels of proficiency are able to effectively contribute to your project.  

Beta testing is a required phase of all publicly launched and [listed](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects) Zooniverse projects, in which a set of volunteers are asked to test your project Workflow(s) and provide feedback on their experience. This is a formal process facilitated by the Zooniverse team. 

Prior to formal beta testing, you should also test your project with friends or family who are trying it for the first time—and watch them as they do it! See where they struggle, ask them for feedback, and review the data they submit. 

As you receive feedback and implement changes, you will iterate through different versions of your project. This will help you produce a Workflow that balances both an intuitive and enjoyable volunteer experience and the best quality data.


## 5.1.1 The project review process

In order to launch your project publicly and be listed on the Zooniverse [project page](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects), you will need to go through project review, which includes an internal review by the Zooniverse team as well as beta review by Zooniverse volunteers. 

Before you apply for review, you should create a beta testing Subject Set and upload it specifically for this purpose. For Transcription Task projects, we recommend creating a beta testing set with around 25 Subjects, depending on how much text each image contains. The aim is to include enough data to last for five to seven days of beta testing, but not so much data that Subjects don’t get retired. That way, your beta test will produce enough completed classifications to be able to test your aggregation and data analysis methods. Your beta test set will need to be linked to an active Workflow. 

In addition, you will need to ensure that your project page, including the About, Team and FAQ sections, contain enough information for your reviewers to gain a sense of your project. Additionally, your project must have a Tutorial, Field Guide and Help text, and your Talk boards must be set up. Apply for review through the ‘Visibility’ tab of the Project Builder. The most up-to-date requirements will be listed there. 

Before we send your project to our volunteers for beta testing, your project will first go through the internal review process, in which a member of the Zooniverse team will review your project based on specific criteria. Your internal review feedback will be delivered via a private Talk board, which your internal reviewer will set up. Make sure you are subscribed to Talk email notifications, so you don’t miss this notification and delay your review process.

The project will then be sent to Zooniverse volunteers who have signed up to be
beta testers. They will submit beta classifications to your project as well as provide
feedback through a standard Google form which is set up for you by the Zooniverse team and linked on your project via the Announcement Banner.


Please note that this process may take some time to complete. Based on past
experience, the entire process can vary from eight-to-sixteen weeks from applying to beta to full launch.


## 5.1.2 When to apply for review

It is important to go through the review process early enough to have enough time to implement any needed changes to both your Subject Sets and your Workflows. You should spend time reviewing and editing your project with contacts, colleagues, or friends so that you can go into the review process with a fairly robust project. 

Depending on the feedback you receive from your internal review and your beta testing, you may elect to go through another round of testing with beta testers after implementing changes, especially if those changes result in a significantly different Workflow requiring different data analysis or quality control methods. You may also decide to test out new Workflows after your project has already launched, though additional beta tests are not required to add new Workflows to a project after it has launched.



## 5.1.3 What feedback is good feedback?

Unfortunately, you will never be able to please everyone, and beta testing is no exception. Much of the feedback you receive will be invaluable, but some of it will be about things you cannot change. 

For example, if you have asked volunteers to transcribe an 18th-century text, helpful feedback may be to include examples of obsolete abbreviations in the Field Guide. Feedback that is less helpful may be that the handwriting is difficult to read. While this is good to know, in that it will help you better prepare volunteers for engaging with difficult scripts, it is also not something that can be resolved through editing your project Workflow. 

Be careful not to overfit your post-beta edits to a small number of people; make sure that you're considering the full scope of the feedback you receive, including those that are in contrast with one another. If one person says they aren't interested in your project, but 10 people say they can't wait to participate, don't waste time trying to appeal to one person.
