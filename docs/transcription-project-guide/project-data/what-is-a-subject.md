# 2.1 What is a Subject? What is a Subject Set?

**IMAGE PLACEHOLDER** 

In Zooniverse parlance, a Subject is a unit of data to be analyzed. For transcription projects, Subjects are images of the text you want your volunteers to transcribe. A single Subject can include more than one image. For example, multi-image Subjects can group pages from the same letter or group pairs of images that are known to be the front and back of a single sheet of paper. 

A Subject Set consists of a group of Subjects (the images) as well as a Manifest (a list of the Subjects and their metadata). You can put all the Subjects in your project into a single Subject Set, or you may choose to break up your data into multiple Subject Sets. You can ask volunteers to perform the same actions on all Subject Sets, or you can assign different actions for each Subject Set, making it an effective way to produce different types of data.

Creating multiple Subject Sets allows you to group your Subjects appropriately for any particular nuance of partitioning that may be useful in your Subject analysis or to create a better volunteer experience. You may choose, for example, to create Subject Sets based on the date of creation, the structure of the data output, or the data source. In one instance, you may choose to group a set of related images—such as all the images from one archival folder or manuscript volume (dozens to hundreds of pages)—together in a Subject Set.

Transcription projects often have natural divisions that make for convenient Subject Sets based on the organization of the material in archives or libraries. However, you can choose not to subdivide into Subject Sets based on those divisions if it makes more sense for your project. If a Subject Set contains images from multiple archival folders or manuscript volumes, your image naming conventions can still indicate these distinctions, or you can include this information in the Subject metadata, to enable you to maintain the connection back to the archival organization. 

## 2.1.1 What makes a good dataset for crowdsourced transcription? 


### 2.1.1.1 Content

Content should be the driving force in your choice of material to transcribe. Here are a few things to think about when choosing datasets: 

* How do the Subjects relate to one another?
* What is the unit of Subject: a single image? Multiple images (e.g. a multi-page letter)? 
* Can longer Subjects be separated in a way that will ease volunteer work without removing crucial context? 
* Can Subjects be divided meaningfully to alleviate unnecessary steps in analysis later on?

### 2.1.1.2 Data management planning

A data management plan is a document that outlines how you intend to organize and maintain all data related to your research.  You can create a data management plan using a template tool like [DMPTool](https://dmptool.org). Keep your data management plan in mind when identifying potential transcription project datasets. How does the organizational structure of your data help or hinder your plans for data analysis and quality control?

### 2.1.1.3 Image quality

Zooniverse sets a strict per-image upper limit of 1MB. In practice, it is best to start out with the best image quality for your Subjects and then manipulate images to meet requirements through standard image processing techniques ([ImageMagick](https://imagemagick.org/index.php), [Adobe](https://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop.html), also a [free-to-use processing notebook utilizing ImageMagick and Google Drive](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1G2ME0Oxa7HSW3pLLD5Rz6EGX9IHLNG_s?usp=sharing)). Subjects must be in the appropriate file format (see the upload box in the Subject Sets tab of the Project Builder for a list of acceptable file types). Each user, by default, can upload 10,000 Subjects to the Zooniverse platform; this limit can be increased upon request by following the instructions (here)[https://www.zooniverse.org/about/contact]. 

If you are creating your own images you can find further information about digital image creation in [Appendix B](https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S0014498322000523-mmc1.pdf) of “[Breathing new life into death certificates](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0014498322000523)” (Bailey, Leonard, Price et al.).
