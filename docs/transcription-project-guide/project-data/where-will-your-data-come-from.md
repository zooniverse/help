# 2.2 Where will your data come from?

This section will provide information on identifying appropriate datasets for use in crowdsourced text transcription projects.

## 2.2.1 How to source project datasets

Transitioning from a specific research interest to a dataset and project environment that is conducive to crowdsourcing can seem like a daunting task. As a project creator, you may source your datasets from one or more archives, libraries, museums, and other institutions, as well as materials you have digitized yourself.  

The digital images created by or at cultural institutions are generally suitable for use in Zooniverse projects, provided you have the right to use them (see 2.2.2 Copyright concerns). You may need to do some preprocessing to make your images the right size for the Zooniverse requirements (see 2.2.1.3 Image quality). 

If there are no digital images of the handwriting you are interested in, you will need to create your own images. There are many factors to consider in undertaking this work. See [the supplemental appendix](https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S0014498322000523-mmc1.pdf) of this article on creating images for [handwriting recognition](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0014498322000523), for which similar considerations apply. 


## Case Study: Sourcing subjects for _The Gravestone Project_ 

The Gravestone Project (TGP) is a digital humanities collective that brings people together to think about the various ways that people memorialize the dead. As part of the BCCCT cohort, The Gravestone Project developed a Zooniverse project to record and transcribe gravestones. However, sourcing these images presented both unique challenges and opportunities.

Rebecca Schneider, Associate Director:

> “There are several institutions, like Find-a-Grave, where we could have sourced subjects from. The crowdsourced transcription, that’s really thrilling. I’m almost more thrilled by the crowd. That’s a huge labor question solved, but I'm personally more excited about the submission of subjects. Because like you said, that means someone’s standing in a graveyard. To me, that’s the benefit or the contribution of physically being there on the ground, reading a gravestone and taking a photo.”

Amy Giroux, Digital Historian & Technical Lead:

> “The memorialization of the people is important. You know, holding that space. The other question that always pops up is we need to have them… say that they’re not relinquishing their copyrights to that image, but we’re allowed to use it. That was another ethical piece—we can't just pilfer a picture. We have to make that effort to go out and obtain permission to use it. And like you said, at the institutional level, it’s a little different thing, you’ve got to have a repository or whatever, it’s more of a legal thing that you have to deal with. But in our case, it’s morally important.”

Rebecca Schneider:

> “For me it’s also that feeling of being in community with those people. It’s sharing this interest, but also this commitment to … commemoration and memorialization. This is truly a collective effort. And we might be putting the most hours into conceiving of the structure and the database and all that, but it wouldn't be what it is without the subjects and if it was just [our team], like even that many people can’t achieve coverage.”


## 2.2.2 Copyright concerns

Copyright issues can be a significant source of delays in bringing text transcription projects to the public. The original handwritten materials you seek to have transcribed may be the property of an archive, library, or museum who received it from another party. The images themselves may have been created by yet another entity. In short, copyright issues with handwritten material can be complicated. Some common copyright situations transcription projects encounter include:

* Material held by a government agency, and the images were created by the government. Often publicly available upon request.
* Material held by a government agency, but the images were created by private entities (e.g. Ancestry). May not be available for transcription, even if viewable on government websites or freely viewable on the private entities website.
* Material created by private individuals, and held by a university, library, private archive, museum or scholarly society have highly variable usage rights. Policies may differ at the collection level within an institution, if the content creator or donor has placed usage restrictions on the material. 

You are responsible for determining whether you have the right to use images in a Zooniverse project. Directly asking the institution(s) who hold the material or images whether you can place the material on Zooniverse is the most straightforward way to proceed. You may need to enter into an agreement with the institution to place them on Zooniverse. [Zooniverse policy](https://help.zooniverse.org/getting-started/lab-policies/#zooniverse-policies) is that you should be sure of your rights to use the images before you make a project public. It is a Zooniverse requirement that you make the data created in your project public. The transcriptions created by your project may be useful data for the institution holding the original images or manuscript material, and offering to share back the resultant transcriptions with the holding institution can sometimes make it easier to get permission to use images. 

If you do not have permission to share images publicly, you will need to consider whether Zooniverse is the appropriate platform for your project.

Roger Panetta, Project Director, _Shadows on Stone_:

> “In those incidents where you are working with archival material or collection, be certain about the copyright clearance and the mechanics of the transfer to the Zooniverse site. The presence of private profit-making intermediaries can complicate this process. Do not despair! You can find workarounds and multiple tasks when such impasses occur.”
