# 8.3 Financial support for projects

Anyone is welcome to create and promote a project using the Zooniverse platform, but historically most of Zooniverse’s project creators are professional researchers who come from a university, cultural institution, or governmental organization. For those in such roles hoping to maintain a project for months or years, it can be crucial to secure long-term support for a project from their organization. Such support is helpful before a project launches. 


## 8.3.1 Institutional support

There is a great deal of labor involved in building a Zooniverse project; monetary or in-kind support from your employer from the beginning helps move projects from ideas to launch. Since the Project Builder allows teams and individuals to prototype projects with minimal technical assistance, it is also possible to get a project up and running in order to show your institution a functional proof of concept. Consider discussing your vision for the project with your institution’s office of public engagement, marketing or communications department, or executive committee early on and keep them updated as your project progresses. The long-term funding needs of each project will vary significantly, but common contributions institutions make come in the form of assistance with external communications and design elements, administrative staff or research assistants, data processing and analysis staff and infrastructure, and dedicated workspace or even dedicated staff. Transcription projects tend to need more data processing and analysis support than other forms of crowdsourcing science and often seek help from information technology units in their institutions. 



## 8.3.2 Grant and gift funding

While institutional buy-in always helps, it is rare for institutions to fund all the needs of long-term crowdsourcing transcription projects. Many researchers are expected to bring in external grants from governments or gifts from donors and foundations. Such external monies can accelerate the timeline of your project or sustain your project for a longer period than you or your organization could alone. The sources of grant funding vary by country, but an excellent primer for understanding the grant application process in fields where transcription projects tend to originate is Raphael Brewster Folsom’s [How to Get Grant Money in the Humanities and Social Sciences](https://yalebooks.yale.edu/book/9780300217438/how-to-get-grant-money-in-the-humanities-and-social-sciences/). Grant application cycles can take over a year, so begin thinking about your project’s needs early and sketch out the aspects of the project that need the most labor or infrastructure in order for the project to succeed. Depending on your technical needs, you may want to consider [reaching out to our team to collaborate](https://blog.zooniverse.org/2020/06/24/the-zooniverse-a-quick-starter-guide-for-research-teams/) on a grant application. 

Obtaining gift funding is much more idiosyncratic than applying for grants, but the best place to begin is by speaking with someone in your organization who works in a ‘development’ or ‘foundation’ unit and guides relationships with existing and potential donors. You might be asked to draft a pitch of your needs and present that to them or even directly to donors. As with institutional support each project’s needs differ, but to help your project thrive in the long term, begin generating your applications and pitches by outlining your overall objectives and working backward to assess the costs associated with activities you’ll need to undertake to meet your goals for the project.
