# 8.5 Wrapping up your Zooniverse project

Though Zooniverse projects can take years and your analysis of their results can take even longer, there often comes a point when your project will need to conclude. This section will give you insights into this process, so that you know what to expect.

## 8.5.1 Sunsetting your project site

Active Zooniverse projects are listed at [https://www.zooniverse.org/projects](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects). When your project runs out of data, it will be automatically moved to the “[Paused](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects?page=1&status=paused)” category. When you are sure your project is finished, you must reach out to the Zooniverse team and ask us to move it to the “[Finished](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects?page=1&status=finished)” category.  

While projects can be deleted, it is our goal for Zooniverse-approved projects to keep an active, public site available as long-term reference to the past effort. The idea is to provide a record of the project, its Talk message boards, and a long-term link that can point to the project's outputs that are available and accessible to volunteer contributors. You may want to consider leaving one or more of your Workflows set to ‘Active’ to allow future visitors to experience the method(s) you used to collect your project data.

When you feel your project has been entirely completed, thank your volunteers via an email newsletter and explain what happens next. Update your Results page accordingly, and don’t forget to submit project publications to our [Publications page](https://www.zooniverse.org/publications). We expect researchers to use the results of the project in peer-reviewed research, and to share results with the community. As detailed in the step above, Classification data must be made accessible within 2 years of the project’s completion, though sooner is preferable.


## 8.5.2 Preserving access to your activities


While your Zooniverse project site can stay ‘live’ indefinitely as a finished project, crowdsourcing projects and researchers’ attendant analyses often produce other research outputs–from books to websites to apps to exhibitions and beyond–that should be thoughtfully organized and made accessible to volunteers and the public, generally. [The Endings Project](https://endings.uvic.ca/), a digital archiving effort from the University of Victoria suggests that researchers with projects that include significant digital elements should consider three questions as their project concludes:
 
1. How should the project conclude?
2. How should the project’s dynamic features be preserved?
3. Where should the project be archived? 
 		
Each project must arrive at their own answers to those questions, but The Endings Project outlines a set of compliance principles to guide researchers through considerations that will help the digital elements of their work have a high likelihood of remaining accessible and even functional for decades. As you reflect on what you’ve accomplished through your Zooniverse project, imagine what you’d like someone to know about your process and results fifty years from now and work toward making those portions of your project sustainable to preserve and legible well into the future.
