# 8.1 Long-term projects

After your project is set up and has launched, you will need to determine how to best maintain your project and support your volunteers over the lifetime of the project, as well as best practices for sunsetting or ‘ending’ your project. By asking volunteers to donate their time and effort to your project, you are committing to the effort of project maintenance and data sharing.

Some projects have a finite set of data that can be transcribed using crowdsourcing over a relatively brief period of weeks or months. However, if your project perpetuates for months or years using new data or even new Tasks and Workflows, you’ll need to consider how to sustain its community of volunteers and perhaps also financial support for administrative, technological, and intellectual labor.

> Work with students (or other enthusiastic volunteers) when possible. I set up an internship for a group of students who helped me with the crowdsourcing project (and other documentary editing work). Their enthusiasm for the subject material was refreshing  and enlivened my interest for what I already knew was a great project, but appreciated an injection of excitement into what I was doing. The students helped me select the best documents to work on for crowdsourcing. And while they were only around for a short time, I got a lot out of explaining crowdsourcing to them and thinking through the documents. *- Serenity Sutherland, BCCCT Cohort Member*
