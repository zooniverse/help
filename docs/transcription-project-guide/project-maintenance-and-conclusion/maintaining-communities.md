# 8.2 Maintaining volunteer communities

Communication (see Section 6) with current and potential volunteers is the foundation of long-term project maintenance. Regularly updating your volunteer community about the progress and current needs of your project is critical for continued engagement. Routine newsletters, social media posts, and Talk updates about whatâ€™s new and ongoing with the project helps volunteers to continue their transcription efforts. Moreover, press releases, media interviews, and other forms of broad outreach can help to engage new audiences particularly when it showcases progress made from initial volunteer contributions. 

The usual output of Zooniverse projects is a [peer-reviewed article](https://www.zooniverse.org/about/publications), conference presentation or book.  But there are many other possible research products and early results of your work can and should be communicated to your volunteers. Keep your volunteer community engaged by communicating what you, your team, or even volunteers have found that offers insight into your documents and the history they tell.   

Project updates can be shared on Zooniverse via Talk and through project-specific [newsletters](https://help.zooniverse.org/next-steps/newsletters/) (which are distinct from the Zooniverse-wide newsletter that announces new projects). These are emails that you can send to your registered volunteers after your project has launched. Newsletters should share your project's progress and will often bring people back to your project. To send out a newsletter, email a plain-text copy to [contact@zooniverse.org](contact@zooniverse.org) and we will send it out for you.
