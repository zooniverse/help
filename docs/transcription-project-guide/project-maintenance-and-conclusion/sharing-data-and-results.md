# 8.4 Sharing data and results


The transcriptions that your volunteers will produce are a significant output that must be made accessible to your volunteers and the public, generally. How teams share their transcription data varies, but you should strive to make it clear to anyone accessing your data what you did to generate it, how they can utilize it, and what you have done or plan to do to analyze it. There are many places available to post and preserve your data. If you are a member of a research institution, your library or archive likely hosts a data repository in which you can deposit your data and even your analysis of the transcriptions. There are alternative options that allow unaffiliated researchers to deposit their data, such as [Dryad](https://datadryad.org/stash), and disciplinary-specific repositories such as [OpenICPSR](https://www.openicpsr.org/openicpsr/) (social science) that enhance the likelihood that members of a specific field will engage with your data.

## 8.4.1 Recording your methods

Regardless of the repository you choose, you should work to provide strong contextual documentation about your project and the methods used to generate your transcriptions and find consensus among them. The best means for documenting the processes you utilized to create your project is to write a readme file. Readme files are text documents that accompany data and guide users through the who, what, when, where, why, and how the data was generated. Cornell University has put together an indispensable [reference](https://data.research.cornell.edu/content/readme) for drafting quality readme files that you should consult when you’re ready to write your own.


## 8.4.2 Packaging your data


In reductive terms, your project will generate some .json files. You could post those files in an open Google Drive and hope that interested parties now and well into the future know what they are and how to utilize and interpret them. But a much more effective means of data sharing is to package your data in a fashion that makes it findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable ([FAIR](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/)). This requires you to decide what to include in your data set (e.g., images, transcriptions, consensus transcriptions, etc.), document your dataset (in a readme, as in the step above), outline the reuse rights of your data (usually by selecting a [Creative Commons](https://creativecommons.org/) license), and transform all files into non-proprietary formats (generic .txt files instead of Microsoft’s .doc file).  

The University of Reading has produced a [detailed guide](https://www.reading.ac.uk/research-services/-/media/project/functions/research-and-enterprise-services/documents/rda-datapreparationguide.pdf?la=en&hash=E4E58E38B5A3DDF6D15D86BD6FD1A193) to preparing your data for a repository, and [the guide](https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/web/pages/deposit/guide/) produced by ICPSR is also useful. As you consider which repository to store your data, prioritize those known to have clear preservation plans that will keep files in working order and publicly accessible for decades or longer. Accrediting entities like the [CoreTrustSeal](https://www.coretrustseal.org) can help you to evaluate repositories you’re considering for your data set.

Additionally, you may want to consider publishing your dataset in a journal, such as the [*Journal of Open Humanities Data*](https://openhumanitiesdata.metajnl.com/about#recommended-repositories). The *JOHD* also provides a list of recommended repositories for their publication requirements.


## 8.4.3 Sharing your insights

Data repositories help to share and preserve your data for generations, but they act as places to preserve your evidence rather than your interpretations. The venues for making arguments from your transcriptions are countless and include books, articles, documentaries, exhibitions, courses, websites, apps, and many other media. Moreover, you can also amplify your interpretive products through traditional and social media channels. Regardless of where you release your interpretations, it’s critical to both acknowledge your volunteers’ labor and to make your volunteers aware of how their labor is leading to your findings. Sharing your interpretive progress with your volunteers during and even after your project is an important part of giving back to your volunteer community and can be accomplished through updates to Talk, newsletters, and other project news sources like social media or a project website.
