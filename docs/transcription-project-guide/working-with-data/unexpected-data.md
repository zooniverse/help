# 7.5 Unexpected data

One of the benefits of a crowdsourced transcription project is that you are engaging with volunteers who come from a wide variety of backgrounds and fields. While you have a specific end-goal of using your classifications, there are many other, often unexpected outputs of a crowdsourced transcription project. 

Talk boards provide one site where volunteers can share data or findings with one another and the research team. For example, the letters of [Poets and Lovers](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/pmlogan/poets-and-lovers) often referenced specific paintings or pieces of art. Volunteers on the project took it upon themselves to look up digitized versions of the artworks mentioned and posted them on Talk. This not only provided a fantastic resource for volunteers who wanted to learn more about the two women authors of the diaries, but also the research team will try to incorporate these links into the published edition of the diaries. Talk boards can be exported from the ‘Data Exports’ tab of the Project Builder as a JSON for easier data analysis.

## Case study: *Poets and Lovers*
[Poets and Lovers](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/pmlogan/poets-and-lovers) is a project to transcribe the diary of Michael Field which was created by two women novelists Katharine Harris Bradley and Edith Emma Cooper.

Peter Logan, Principal Investigator:

> The questions aren't hard and if I can't answer them, I tell one of my partners to get involved, and they'll know the answer. And some of the questions have been very interesting too. Some of them brought up things we didn't know about. So that was an unexpected outcome. We did actually learn things about what's in these diaries that we didn't know about. [The authors] talk a lot about paintings in the diaries, and I was going to write up [the volunteers] responses to the paintings. One of the volunteers found links to online images of the paintings, so we can incorporate them into the transcription. Which is exactly what we're going to do.


Project outputs are not limited to data. By virtue of the nature of crowdsourced transcription projects, research and data are opened up to more people. Many project teams have seen the engagement with the public as a vital output of their work, and have structured their research and project around that engagement. For example, the [Mapping Prejudice](https://mappingprejudice.umn.edu/) team primarily worked with volunteers directly through meetings. They saw the work of educating people on the history of racial covenants through these in-person or small virtual events as an integral practice for their community work. Here, the *process* of crowdsourced transcription was as important of an output as the data.
