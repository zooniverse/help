# 7.6 Data curation

Depending on your affiliations, aspirations, and your project’s goals for presenting data, there may be several ways to preserve and share your project’s results. The most straightforward and cost-effective way for you as a researcher would be to utilize an affiliate institution's data repository (ones with the [CoreTrustSeal](https://www.coretrustseal.org) are best). These institutional repositories allow for consistent access and long-term presentation of your data while allowing you to organize your data in a clear and detailed manner. If you are not a part of an institution, good options for preserving and publishing your data are the [Open Science Framework](https://osf.io/) and [Dryad](https://datadryad.org/stash). In the social sciences, a widely used data repository is [Open ICSPR](https://www.openicpsr.org/openicpsr/).
