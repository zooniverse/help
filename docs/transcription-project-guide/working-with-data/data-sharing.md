# 7.4 Data sharing requirement

Projects promoted to the Zooniverse community have the goal of producing useful research; your study needs to be well designed, and you must intend to analyze and write up your results as a formal publication. You must make volunteer classification data open within two years of a projectâ€™s completion. You also commit to communicating research findings to your volunteer community. Finally, you must formally [acknowledge Zooniverse](https://www.zooniverse.org/about/acknowledgements) in any publications.
Please report publications using Zooniverse-produced data to us via this [form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/18jwLbtV_6M5HCM74xNFtFbiiszWAxpC5IGHaToYjeiw/viewform).
