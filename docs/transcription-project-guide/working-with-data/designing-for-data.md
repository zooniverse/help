# 7.1 Designing for data output

The primary objective of your Zooniverse project involves transforming an existing dataset (images of handwriting) into another form of dataset (lines and perhaps columns of text) that can be analyzed more efficiently to achieve the broader goals of your project. This transcription data may take on various forms depending on your plans for use. In this section, weâ€™ll consider how your data can be processed, stored, analyzed, and shared during the course of your Zooniverse project and after it is completed. 


Before creating your project, you should know what kind of data you want to collect. Your final data set will comprise a consensus for each Task in your Workflow for a given Subject. Keeping this in mind allows you to think of an ideal architecture for building your project and the provided tools to onboard your historical information to a usable digital dataset.
