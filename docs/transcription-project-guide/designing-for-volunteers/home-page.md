A major part of designing a successful project is writing effective copy. On the Zooniverse platform alone, there can be dozens of [other projects to choose from](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects), let alone the rest of the internet—what makes yours special? Why should people donate their time to helping you? 

Take time choosing a project name and writing the project description and Introduction. These are the first things people will see when they visit your project, so make sure they are accessible and interesting. Avoid long exposition and project history, as this information can go in the About page. Use action words, avoid jargon, and make sure to mention your main Task type. For example, in this case, “Help us transcribe XYZ…” is more effective than “We are digitizing XYZ and want to create digital searchable text via crowdsourced transcription.” For more on [writing an effective call to action](https://britishlibrary.pubpub.org/pub/supporting-participants#create-an-effective-call-to-action), see The Collective Wisdom Handbook chapter 9, “Supporting participants.”


## 4.2.1 Making use of images

The images you include in your project (illustrative images that aren’t Subjects to be Classified) should help volunteers better understand what you are asking them to do (e.g. screenshots of the project’s user interface), or illustrate concepts you are trying to explain (e.g. page layout, script types, etc.). Upload images via the Media tab of the Project Builder. You can resize images before uploading, or after uploading using [Markdown](https://help.zooniverse.org/next-steps/markdown/). We recommend keeping your Media images under 500KB, to avoid long load times. Modifying screenshots of your user interface can quickly help volunteers understand what you are asking them to do.

In this slide, the instructions describe how to use image manipulation tools like pan, zoom, and rotate. The Tutorial image displays what these buttons look like in the project classification interface.](/img/transcription-images/4-2-1_pc_tutorial.png)](/img/transcription-images/4-2-1_pc_tutorial.png)

### 4.2.1.1 Media

The Media tab of the Project Builder allows you to upload media to your project (such as example images for your Help pages or Tutorial) so you can link to it without an external host. To start uploading, drop an image into the gray box (or click ‘Select files’ to bring up your file browser and select a file). Once the image has been uploaded, it will appear above the ‘Add an image’ box. You can then copy the Markdown text beneath the image into your project, or add another image. 


## 4.2.2 Markdown

The Project Builder supports [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/basics), a markup language that allows you to create formatted text via a plain-text editor. The Project Builder features a short Markdown guide, which you can reach by clicking the ‘?’ icon in the upper right corner of any text entry field. A more detailed Markdown guide is available at [https://help.zooniverse.org/next-steps/markdown/ ](https://help.zooniverse.org/next-steps/markdown/)
