# 4.1 Who are the volunteers?

Volunteers are the most important part of any crowdsourcing project. This section will provide guidance around user-centered project design.


## 4.1.1 Building an ethical project

Research crowdsourcing differs from traditional micro-work platforms (e.g., Amazon’s Mechanical Turk) in that volunteers are not paid for their labor. Because of this, it is your job as a project creator to consider how your volunteers benefit from taking part in your project. Below are some important ethical considerations to bear in mind while crafting your project.

Rebecca Schneider, Associate Director, _The Gravestone Project_:

> “Backward, or User-centered design principles helped us to conceptualize who else might use the data we hoped to generate and how that data could be used in other disciplines, as well as by non-academic stakeholders. It was thrilling to consider design choices with these other users in mind. It also struck me as an essentially ethical concern to plan for both anticipated and unanticipated consumers of the data (to the extent that’s even possible).”


### 4.1.1.1 Know your values

According to [The Collective Wisdom Handbook](https://doi.org/10.21428/a5d7554f.1b80974b) (Ridge, Blickhan, Ferriter et al.), reflection on the power dynamics present within crowdsourcing projects can help to empower crowdsourcing project creators to “create equitable and transformative spaces, communication, and activities.” We strongly encourage teams to establish their values at the start of their project planning, and to revisit these values throughout the project lifecycle. As the Handbook also states, “Failing to articulate what is important, and how you will demonstrate it, will lead to you missing a vital component of how your project is organized.”


### 4.1.1.2 People-forward thinking

Keep volunteers in mind at all times. Part of creating a good crowdsourcing project is considering the perspective of the people who will be taking part in your project. How can the design choices you make create a positive user experience? A great way to ensure you’re engaging in people-forward thinking is to try out [other projects](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects) – creators who take part in other crowdsourcing projects as volunteers tend to have an easier time thinking about the volunteer experience.



### 4.1.1.3 Don't waste volunteers' time

**You must have a plan for working with your data before you launch your project.**

The most common problem for transcription projects is teams not being prepared to use their resulting data. Before you involve the public, you must have a plan for how you will aggregate, review, clean, and store the transcriptions produced through your crowdsourcing project. If you do not know how you will do one or more of these things, you risk asking the public to donate their time, only for the data never to be used. Wasting volunteers’ time is the cardinal sin of crowdsourcing, and something to avoid at all costs.



### 4.1.1.4 Always experiment and iterate (even before Beta testing)

Putting in the additional effort early and often in the process will require more labor for you and your team, but it will almost always result in a better experience for your volunteers—and higher-quality results. You should walk through your Workflows and Tasks at every step of your process (even before building your project in Zooniverse). It is almost always helpful to also have people less familiar with your data go through the Workflow to uncover assumptions you may make based on your own expertise. 


## Case Study: Working with difficult materials

_The Crocker Land Expedition_ focuses on a 1913 exploration of the existence of a huge island called Crocker Land that famous explorer Robert Peary claimed to have seen. Although we now know the land does not exist, the expedition to the area produced important scientific research. As part of the BCCCT cohort Rebecca Morgan explored how the Zooniverse could be used to create a platform for transcribing the diverse material gathered by the expedition, much of which is held at the American Museum of Natural History.


Rebecca Morgan, Project Director:

> “I wonder about building a community of people that are working on documents that might potentially over you know, days or an hour or whatever, affect them. The [subject sets] may seem innocuous, innocuous on the outside, but after immersing yourself in however many profiles of Sing Sing prisoners or a whole tome on interactions with Indigenous folks and animals, they can take a toll. Especially if you're not ready for it, it can take its toll. And I'm not saying necessarily that it's a bad toll and seeing how important the close reading, skill development... These materials demand some perspective, some thoughtfulness, but I think if someone's just jumping into this to pass the time, or for fun, I don't know if we need trigger warnings on stuff, but we need to figure out a way to work with it and what we owe our community as far as being explicit about that.”


## 4.1.2 Finding your community


One benefit of using Zooniverse for your crowdsourcing project is the built-in community of millions of potential volunteers. However, not all registered Zooniverse volunteers will take part in your project—you should expect to do some recruiting of your own. Ideally, you want a mix of people familiar with the Zooniverse platform as well as those who bring existing expertise or interest in your subject matter. Publicizing your project on subject-specific listservs, community message boards and via social media accounts can help create interest from others with an existing interest in your project topic. Finding a blend of these groups will help to create a well-balanced community who will not only help your project, but can assist one another with technical questions as well as tricky transcriptions.
