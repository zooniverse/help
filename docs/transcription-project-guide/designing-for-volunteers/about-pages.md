# 4.4 About pages

The About pages are a space for you to share details about your project, its history and outcomes. This section will provide details on what type of information to include, and how About pages can be a source of support for project volunteers.

## 4.4.1 Research

This section should include the project background (including any funding sources), brief historical context (what will this work contribute to the field?), project goals (including any related work happening outside the Zooniverse project), and planned research outputs (in particular, where volunteers can plan to access project results). Essentially, this is where you have space to justify to volunteers: 1) why you need their help; and 2) how their efforts will affect the research.


## 4.4.2 Team

Who is working on this project? This section should list all project team members, their institutional affiliation, research specialization, and specific role within the project. Photos are encouraged, if team members are comfortable sharing. Additionally, if there is a specific email address volunteers should use to contact the team, this is a great place to put that information (if you haven't yet, you may want to consider establishing an email address for your project). The Zooniverse username of all Collaborators will be listed here as well. 


## 4.4.3 Results

This section should include links to results when available, and will ideally also include a short description of project results. Before results are available (e.g. at the project launch), we encourage you to signpost where you are planning to host the project results. This communicates to potential volunteers that you understand the platform requirements for making data publicly available and are committed to doing so.


## 4.4.4 Education

This section is where you can share resources for educators, students, or anyone interested in learning more about your research topic. It is a great place to include additional reading or considerations. You can also post resources that may be used in conjunction with your project, such as syllabi and pedagogical tools. 


## 4.4.5 FAQ

This section should list frequently asked questions about your project. You can start by including anticipated questions, but the expectation is that you will add to this list after your initial beta test, as well as after the projectâ€™s public launch. 

* Keep FAQ items concise and easy to read. 
* Bulleted lists are preferable to paragraphs of text.
