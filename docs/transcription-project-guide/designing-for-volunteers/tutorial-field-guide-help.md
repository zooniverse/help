# 4.5 Tutorial, Field Guide, and Help Text

You can support volunteers with additional information in three places. There may be some overlap in the content of these resources, and volunteers will encounter them at different points in their work.

Content for each of these resources is rendered with Markdown, so you can use any media you’ve uploaded for your project in this space. Upload media for your project (illustrative images that aren’t Subjects to be classified) in the Media tab of the Project Builder. Visuals help tremendously in making your support resources easier to understand. 


## 4.5.1 What is a Tutorial?

Tutorials appear the first time a volunteer opens a Workflow on your project. You can use the Tutorial tab to build a step-by-step guide to participating in your project. Tutorials are Workflow-specific; if your project has multiple Workflows, you should design a Tutorial for each one. Volunteers should come away with an understanding of your basic project goals (why are you doing this?) and what they will be asked to do if they choose to participate. You can upload images and enter text for each step. There is no limit to how many steps you can add, but we encourage you to aim for 6 steps or fewer. Remember: the longer your Tutorial, the less likely it is that volunteers will read the whole thing.

Assign Tutorials to your Workflows via the Workflows tab of the Project Builder. More info on writing Tutorials is available on the [Zooniverse blog](https://blog.zooniverse.org/2019/06/13/top-ten-tips-writing-a-great-zooniverse-tutorial/).

## 4.5.2 What is a Field Guide?

The Field Guide is a space for you to provide information on the project content that helps volunteers become more proficient at interpreting your source material. Examples might include frequently-used abbreviations, lists of common places and names, or explanations of period-specific writing conventions (e.g. the long s, cross-writing, etc.) Information can be grouped into different sections; each section should have a title and an icon. The Field Guide can also host a general background to your material and research Subject.

In this image, the Field Guide offers help on basics of how to transcribe, transcribe text modifiers such as strikethroughs, read 19th century handwriting, skip pages, handle blank pages, address cut off words, note text in margins, and transcribe typed text.](/img/transcription-images/4-5-2_pc_fg.png)](/img/transcription-images/4-5-2_pc_fg.png)

## 4.5.3 What is Help Text?

You need to provide Help text for all Tasks in your project Workflow(s). This information should help volunteers complete the Task they are currently being asked to complete. It is a space for specific instructions on how to use the tools provided for that particular step of the Workflow, not necessarily how to interpret the content (that’s what the Field Guide is for).


## Case Study: Talk support

Letters to and from authors provide scholars and readers with new insights into what authors were thinking about  that didn’t make it into print. In the _Maria Edgeworth Letters_ project, transcribing letters held in one place makes the material more widely accessible and provides volunteers with exciting opportunities to learn more about the thoughts behind the printed word.  


Hilary Havens, Co-Principal Investigator:

> “One of the most challenging and time-consuming, but also one of the most rewarding parts of the project has been interacting with volunteers on the Talk Boards. This becomes relevant as soon as your project enters beta testing, but you should work on the Talk Boards even before then. My collaborators and I thought we did a good job with our Tutorial, Help Text, and Field Guide, but once we started seeing comments from the volunteers, we realized how wrong we were! Many of the volunteers – especially the beta testers - were much more experienced than us in dealing with Zooniverse projects and knew exactly what we were missing. Our Help Text for the transcription tool needed to be more specific and have more pictures. We needed to cover many more edge cases in the Field Guide (such as tables, damaged pages, and the British pound sign). The Talk Boards helped us improve our project immeasurably. They also take a tremendous amount of time – especially in the beta period and early weeks of the projects – as the volunteers help the project team explain and improve things.

> The Talk Boards also helped us provide guidance to the volunteers beyond the Field Guide, Tutorial, and Help Text. Maria Edgeworth and her circle have difficult handwriting, and we devoted an entire section of the boards to a handwriting guide that an undergraduate research assistant undertook as a project. The guide was very popular with volunteers and editors alike adding numerous entries linked to weird writerly quirks, like Edgeworth’s k’s that look like they have an “e” at the end.

> Overall, the Talk Boards have been the place to actually engage with the public regarding the project and share our interest in the material. We have had marvelous discussions with our contributors on topics like Edgeworth’s interest in lace, her views of other writers, her opinions on deafness and disability and how those would be viewed today. Our contributors have found and continue to find allusions to people, places, works, and other things that will be incredibly helpful as we take the project to the next stage: correct the transcriptions, encode the letters, and add notes. We have a dedicated research assistant to help extract information from their posts and find a consistent way to credit contributions from the Talk boards, which is the next step in our plans.”
