# 4.3 Talk

'Talk' is the name given to the message board system that comes with every Zooniverse project. This section will explain what Talk is, and how to use it to the advantage of your project as well as your community.

## 4.3.1 What are Talk boards for?

‘Talk’ is the name for the discussion boards attached to your project. On Talk, volunteers can discuss your project and data with each other, as well as with you and your team. **Maintaining a vibrant and active Talk is essential for keeping your volunteers engaged with the project.** Conversations on Talk can also lead to additional research discoveries, as volunteers bring their own interests and expertise to the project. 


## 4.3.2 How to build Talk boards

In the Talk tab of the Project Builder, first activate the default Subject-discussion board, which hosts a single dedicated conversation for each Subject you upload to the project. Then add additional boards for conversations about a general topic. Examples might include: ‘Announcements,’ ‘Project Discussion,’ ‘Questions for the Research Team,’ or ‘Technical Support.’ 

To get email notifications when volunteers post on Talk, make sure you 1) have your Notification preferences turned on, and 2) have checked your Talk email preferences. Both can be adjusted at zooniverse.org/settings (this page is also accessible by clicking on your username in the top right corner of the screen).

## Case Study: Keeping up with Talk

_The People’s Contest Digital Archive_ is a project led by the Richards Center at the Pennsylvania State University to transcribe Civil War era documents from Pennsylvania. Transcribing through the Zooniverse platform was an opportunity to broaden access to documents in collections at Penn State and elsewhere in Pennsylvania. 

Kevin Clair, Project Coordinator:

> “It is important to keep up with the Talk boards in your Zooniverse project every day, especially at the outset (after your launch). There will be a great deal of activity, and most of it will be questions about Zooniverse itself, or about the materials you have made available for your transcription project. The Zooniverse team are very quick with responses to technical questions if you forward them along, but only you will be able to answer questions about your materials (and you will get them!).

> You will notice, after your project has been around for a while, that your Talk boards will take on a life of their own and you will not need to monitor them as closely. Most of the responses we have received in the People’s Contest Digital Archive have been to point out blank pages for others, or to note pages that have been damaged or are otherwise unreadable. Also, some volunteers will also be contributing to other digital humanities projects on Zooniverse, and will be able to provide answers to people’s questions or help to fix problems they are having with the platform—in many cases even before you or the Zooniverse team know that they’re a problem…

> Our Talk boards have also led to improvements to the project itself. Once enough people have asked the same questions about how to transcribe something, it’s time to add it to our Tutorial or Field Guide so we have a resource to which we can point people.”
