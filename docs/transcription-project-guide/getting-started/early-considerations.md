# 1.5 Early considerations

This section will signpost some things to think about early on as you begin to conceptualize and design your project.

## 1.5.1 What are your short- and long-term goals?

A clear understanding of your broader project goals is vital as you develop your plan for  crowdsourcing the transcription of handwritten text. We noted earlier that we make few assumptions about your disciplines or background. But whatever discipline you are working in, Zooniverse [requires](https://help.zooniverse.org/getting-started/lab-policies/) that projects have the goal of producing useful research. Across the diversity of your research fields it is likely that your goals are to:

1. Produce data (text) that you share so that other people can study the text, and present and publish results.
1. Produce data that you will initially analyze, present, and publish. You will then make the data public in accordance with Zooniverse policies.

Crowdsourcing takes time. Sometimes it proceeds more quickly than expected, and other times more slowly. You should identify short-term analysis, presentation, and publication objectives that can be achieved with only a small share of the text transcribed and aggregated. What is a particularly interesting subset of your data that you can write about? In transcription projects these subsets of the data are often identified by the project leads. Some science projects might be able to use a random sample of images, but this probably doesn’t work for letters, diaries, and drafts of literary works. Identify your highest priority material, and prioritize those images for transcription. Using early results to demonstrate that volunteer work is contributing to discoveries and being shared is tremendously encouraging for your volunteers, and can help with volunteer retention, especially in long-running projects.

Showing initial results and the viability of your work is also important in seeking more funding for your project. Grant funds can help provide your team with the additional skills and resources it requires (see Section 8).

Working with volunteers can take your work in new and unexpected directions, as you collaboratively discover unexpected things via the initial transcriptions. Only you can decide whether to pursue these new directions by evaluating them in relation to your long-term goals. 

Articulating long-term goals is important for all transcription projects. For projects led by one or two people, clearly stating long-term goals will help you prioritize your work as your project progresses. Crowdsourcing projects led by a small team can falter when there are other demands on people’s time. Articulating long-term goals at the beginning of a project can help larger collectives and institutions with structured discussion of where a project is going, and help with aligning staff work with project needs.  

We encourage you to build towards your long-term goals with a series of short-term achievable objectives that can be communicated to volunteers and other collaborators. 

## 1.5.2 Where will your project and its data live?

Zooniverse provides all projects with an online transcription interface (where the work of volunteers is done) and a dedicated message board, called Talk, where you can interact with your project community (see Section 4.3). You should also consider how to develop a presence for your project in other ways, both online and offline (see Section 6 on working with volunteers).  

Many projects have established separate websites that give further background on the broader goals of the project. These are most often hosted by affiliate institutions. Project-specific social media accounts can also be useful in calling attention to your work, recruiting volunteers, and publicizing data and publications. Because the social media landscape is rapidly changing and project needs vary, we do not give advice on which platforms to use. We do recommend that you establish an identity for your project that is separate from the personal or professional accounts of project leaders (though they can and should amplify project messages).

When you have data to share, a project website can be an additional venue for publicizing the availability of data by linking to a trusted data repository. It is vitally important that you have robust systems for storing your images, programs and data. Because the work of crowdsourcing projects is collaborative, you should develop a system that allows data and programs to be shared and accessed by all members of your team, and a workable system for communicating about your project. 

When you have developed final aggregated versions of your transcription data, you must share this publicly (see Section 8). 


## 1.5.3 What types of support do you have? What types of support should you seek?

This chart lists the seven main steps of building a Zooniverse project (the same steps shown in the chart in section 1.3.2). Under each is a bulleted list of skills that are helpful at that step.

[![A list entitled “Project Team Skills”. It lists the 7 main steps of building a Zooniverse project. Under each is a bulleted list of skills that are helpful at that step. The list reads: 1. Identify and Source your data: a) Digital image creation and preservation; b) File management. 2. Create a strategic plan: a) project planning; b) Subject matter expertise. 3. Build your project: a) User experience design; b) File management; c) Subject matter expertise. 4. Test and revise: a)  User experience design; b) User testing; c) Implementation. 5. Launch your project: a) Social movement leadership; b) Outreach and social media. 6. Analyze data: a) File management, b) Scripting and programming, c) Data analysis. 7. Publish and conclude: a) writing and editing; b) Publishing. Below the table are 3 institutional logos: the National Endowment for the Humanities, the University of Minnesota, and Zooniverse overlaid on the Adler Planetarium icon.](/img/transcription-images/1-5-3_project_team_skills.png)](/img/transcription-images/1-5-3_project_team_skills.png)

Crowdsourcing text transcription requires the application of a range of different skills, potentially including digital image creation (photography and digital preservation), organizing and manipulating large volumes of digital images (file management), designing an appropriate Workflow for transcription (user experience design), recruiting and working with volunteers (social movement leadership), data cleaning and analysis (file management, scripting and programming), and presenting and publishing analyses. 

This is a wide range of different skills, and it is a rare person who will be skilled in all of the above listed areas. We encourage you to build collaborations with people who have complementary skills, particularly if you are reading this as a lone researcher, or a smaller group of two to three people. If your team does not have the skills required, do you have the time and resources to allocate for a team member to learn them, or can you form a collaboration to bring these skills to your project? 

Many crowdsourcing project creators (and potential project creators) are at universities or based in libraries, archives, and museums. Resources for learning these skills are likely available to you via your institution. You are also likely to have colleagues with complementary skills. Collaboration with students or interns who have skills relevant for your project can be mutually beneficial when approached in the right way. If you work with students or interns, ensure they receive appropriate credit and reward for their work. Recruiting collaborators is valuable practice for recruiting volunteers, as you must articulate why your project is interesting, and why other people should become involved. 

Identifying the skills and resources you have, what you need, and the gap between them is an important part of your strategic plan for your project. As you read this guide, try to identify areas where there is a gap between your current team’s skills and resources and what you need to construct useful and usable text data. How will you acquire those skills and resources by the time you need them?


## Case Study: The benefits of collaboration

Letters to and from authors provide scholars and readers with new insights into what authors were thinking about  that didn’t make it into print. In the _Maria Edgeworth Letters_ project, transcribing letters held in one place makes the material more widely accessible and provides volunteers with exciting opportunities to learn more about the thoughts behind the printed word.

> “I'm very fortunate to be part of a project that has a lot of collaborators. We have four librarians who frequently give us advice. And having them help produce things like the personography, or check our metadata, check our TEI template, make sure we're linking to name authorities . . . having this knowledge that would be very hard for an English professor to acquire is great. And having someone who knows so much about metadata and name authorities takes a lot of pressure off other people doing other things.”
