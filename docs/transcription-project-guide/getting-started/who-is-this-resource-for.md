# 1.1 Who is this resource for?

This guide is aimed at people who want to transcribe a large amount of handwritten text using volunteer crowdsourcing. You will either have an existing collection of digital images, or have identified manuscript or archival sources that you plan to make digital  images of, which will be transcribed through the effort of volunteers. This guide is a comprehensive introduction to the lifecycle of a crowdsourced transcription project using the Zooniverse platform, covering technological and social aspects of such projects.

You may be interested in crowdsourcing because the volume of material you have is larger than you or your research team could transcribe alone. If you plan to ask volunteers to participate, you need to make the transcription process meaningful and rewarding. Thus we carry through this guide an assumption that the material you are interested in transcribing will be of interest to others beyond your immediate use case. 

Crowdsourcing text transcription is of interest to a wide range of people. We have tried to write this guide with an awareness of the variety of interests and materials that may have brought you here. Our advice is not tailored to assumptions about your disciplinary background, institutional affiliation, or educational status, though those may well affect how you go about implementing the advice we give. Handwritten pages are important sources for meteorologists and medievalists, physicists and poets, economists and ecologists. Text transcription projects often originate from teams in museums, libraries, universities, government agencies, archives, genealogical organizations, and scholarly societies, but can be hosted by individuals or other organizations, too. A project to crowdsource the transcription of text may take a year or more to complete, and so we assume that you—individually or collectively—can sustain your project over a long period of time, and be comfortable with uncertainty about how long it takes. 

This guide was developed as part of an NEH-funded Institute for Advanced Topics in Digital Humanities, [Building Capable Communities for Crowdsourced Transcription](https://sites.google.com/umn.edu/atdhcrowdcohort/home), that ran from 2021 to 2023. The authors of the guide worked with 15 project teams in seven online meetings and one in-person meeting to build crowdsourced transcription projects on the Zooniverse platform. This guide was informed by the questions and experiences of those projects, as well as our experience designing and teaching the institute. 

This guide was written collectively by the Co-Directors of the institute, and its two research assistants.

We have written this guide in the first person, addressing our advice to “you” as a member of a team building a crowdsourced transcription project. When we refer to technical terms related to the Zooniverse we have capitalized the words.
