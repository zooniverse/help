# 1.2 How to use this resource

We have written this guide to take you through the entire lifecycle of a crowdsourcing project. We encourage you to read the entire guide as you consider whether crowdsourcing is the right approach for your project and sources, and whether Zooniverse is the appropriate platform for your needs. As you develop, launch, sustain, and wind down your project in the months and years to come, we hope you will come back to relevant sections to consult in more detail. 

We encourage you to begin by using this guide to assist you in creating a strategic plan for your project. While there are important common elements to all crowdsourced transcription projects, every project is unique in some way. You must make decisions about what will work best for your source material, goals, and team of people. This guide aims to help you narrow down those choices and understand the tradeoffs. 

As you read this guide you will notice that we offer advice about different choices you can make in various phases of your project. Take the time to write down your thoughts about what you will do, and review these before you start the serious work of collecting and organizing images and developing Tasks and Workflows. You should think about when you need the data and how likely delays will affect your other work. Your volunteer community is not working on your timetable. Revisit your strategic plan as you make and implement decisions.
