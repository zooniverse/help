# 1.4 What is crowdsourced text transcription?

This section will provide context around methods and history of crowdsourcing, with a focus on transcribing text. It will dive into ethical approaches, motivations for transcribing, and best practices for developing goals and objectives for your project.

## 1.4.1 What is crowdsourcing? 

Historically, crowdsourcing was conceived of as a way to outsource labor to the crowd via an open call (Howe). This model of crowdsourcing persists today as microwork (see for example [Amazon’s Mechanical Turk](https://www.mturk.com/), [Appen](https://appen.com/) or [Clickworker](https://www.clickworker.com/), all of which pay gig workers on a per-task basis to produce training data for machine learning models). Since the term was first used in 2006, research crowdsourcing has largely deviated from the original definition in the sense that it is not paid work, but a way to involve the public in research in meaningful ways.

For a text transcription specific definition of crowdsourcing, we look to [The Collective Wisdom Handbook: perspectives on crowdsourcing in cultural heritage](https://doi.org/10.21428/a5d7554f.1b80974b): “At its best, [crowdsourcing] is a form of digitally-enabled participation that creates meaningful opportunities for the public to experience collections while undertaking a range of tasks that make those collections more easily discoverable and usable by others.” (Ridge, Blickhan, Ferriter, et al.) 

The most common humanities crowdsourcing task is text transcription, in which volunteers help to create digital, searchable versions of text found in digital images of archival records.


### 1.4.1.1 The ethics of crowdsourcing

Because there is no financial reward for taking part in crowdsourcing, it is up to practitioners and project creators to produce “human-centered projects that deliver benefits to all involved” (Ridge, Blickhan, Ferriter et al.). The best way to ensure you are creating an ethical project is by establishing values and letting those values drive your project design and testing processes as well as the ways you involve and engage with volunteers. 

Values are broad, and can include everything from committing to only publish project research in open-access journals, to including warnings on projects dealing with potentially traumatizing content, to clearly articulating how you plan to acknowledge volunteer effort in publications. Values can and should evolve over the course of your project. A good project includes places where you and your team are able to take a moment to check in on your values and either update them based on your experiences, or actively choose to keep them. Your project cannot be values-agnostic; choosing not to articulate your values is de facto support of existing power structures (Ridge, Blickhan, Ferriter et al.).

Human-centered projects mean keeping people in mind at every stage. When designing your crowdsourcing project, consider this: how do volunteers benefit from helping transcribe this text? What can you do to ensure a positive user experience, and make sure that volunteers’ labor is being used efficiently? If you are working with students, how are you accounting for the additional power dynamics in place within the student/teacher relationship? Zooniverse requires all project creators to make their data publicly available within two years of the project’s completion—how does your data management plan account for this requirement?  These framing questions can help you get started thinking through the ethical considerations of your project; further ethical issues are considered in Section 6: Acknowledging Volunteers.




## 1.4.2 Why transcribe?

Before getting into the specifics about why you want to transcribe, this table will help you think more broadly about why to crowdsource more broadly.

[![A table entitled ‘Why Crowdsource?’. It lists 3 main categories: Scale, Discoverability, and Engagement. Under Scale, it reads: 1) Too much to do on your own, 2) Cannot be automated. Under Discoverability: 1) Data processing and transformation, 2) Increased access to collections, 3) Create or expand reusable datasets, 4) Broaden, deepend and diversify corpora. Under Engagement: 1) Opportunities for exploration, 2) Encourage institutional transparency, 3) Work with communities. Below the table are 3 institutional logos: the National Endowment for the Humanities, the University of Minnesota, and Zooniverse overlaid on the Adler Planetarium icon.](/img/transcription-images/1-4_why_crowdsource.png)](/img/transcription-images/1-4_why_crowdsource.png)


### 1.4.2.1 Identifying your needs

If your motivations are only coming from one of the above three categories (Scale, Discoverability, or Engagement), there’s a good chance you’re going to run into problems. Either you are too focused on data and not focused enough on people, or you’ve put too much of a focus on the public project itself and haven’t given enough thought to your data management practices or whether you even need to ask the public for their help.


### 1.4.2.2 Is Zooniverse the appropriate platform for your project?

Zooniverse projects benefit from 1) the ease of using the Project Builder; and 2) the size of the existing volunteer community. With that said, designing, building and running a crowdsourcing project requires a lot of effort and resources, especially in the form of staff time. Planning out your project in advance will help you confirm that you have the resources and bandwidth to take on this responsibility. For more information on selecting platforms, see [The Collective Wisdom Handbook](https://doi.org/10.21428/a5d7554f.1b80974b), Ch. 7, Aligning tasks, platforms, and goals.


## Case Study: New tools for transcription at scale

_The People’s Contest Digital Archive_ is a project led by the Richards Center at the Pennsylvania State University to transcribe Civil War era documents from Pennsylvania. Transcribing through the Zooniverse platform was an opportunity to broaden access to documents in collections at Penn State and elsewhere in Pennsylvania. 

Kevin Clair, Project Coordinator: 

> “As a librarian tasked with digital collection stewardship, my team and I are always interested in new ways to provide access to our collections for users and to engage with our community in new and interesting ways. For us, publishing our collections as data opens them up to new methods of analysis and can allow connections to be made between materials in the collections that can’t be made through resource description or close reading alone. Working with Zooniverse, particularly with a project that already had a degree of existing transcription, gave us the tools and the impetus to find a methodology for publishing transcriptions at scale that we could refine for future projects like this.”


## 1.4.3 Develop research goals and objectives

Goals are high-level ideas, and objectives are the actions you take in service of those goals. You should identify your project goals and objectives early on in the project planning process.


### 1.4.3.1 What are your broad research goals?

Your goal here is likely to create digital, searchable text through crowdsourced transcription. Do you have additional research goals that are related to the content of the transcribed text? It helps to map out the full extent of your project goals at the start, as this should drive your decision-making process.


### 1.4.3.2 Breaking your project into smaller pieces (objectives)

For the goal of creating digital, searchable text through crowdsourced transcription, objectives might include identifying team members, creating a data management plan, identifying and securing funding, designing Workflows, and getting buy-in from institutional administrators.

Kevin Clair, Project Coordinator, _The People's Contest Digital Archive_:

> “Methods for measuring engagement are also something that digital collections programs have found elusive. Having engagement visible as directly as it is with a community transcription project – through the Zooniverse Talk boards, or even through the steady stream of subjects awaiting final approval – is something we can take directly to supervisors and administrators to document the impact that our digitization program is having on visibility of digital content from the library.”


### 1.4.3.3 What should be done through Zooniverse?

As the list above shows, not all of your goals and objectives will take place on Zooniverse, though there will be many points where the success of your ‘offline’ objectives directly impacts your Zooniverse project. When mapping out your goals and objectives, take care to consider what tasks truly need to be crowdsourced, and what can be done internally—often, the labor required to work with crowdsourced data can outweigh what would be required for institutional staff to do the work themselves. You should also explore what parts of your project could be performed by a computer—what is technologically feasible is changing rapidly and will vary across different sources. Thinking through the full scope of your project can help you to identify what scale of project you are able to take on. 


## Case Study: Developing a strategic plan

_Deciphering Secrets: Unlocking the Manuscripts of Medieval Spain_ brings medieval Spanish manuscripts online, and provides volunteers with the opportunity to learn paleography before participating in transcription.

Roger Martinez, Project Director:

> “I think the challenge here is that, as humanists start to work more closely with technology, we weren't trained to use these types of materials and then we don't know the critical kind of steps you have to run through. It's not like in history, where we know that you’re going to do something like a historiographical session, we're going to present an argument... you don't have the same kind of guideposts. 

> You don’t know what you don’t know. So I think the steps have to be related to, starting with the highest level, what are the goals and objectives of the project? And from there, it’s really, how are you going to measure and assess your progress towards those goals? Then also, for the next step, really thinking through, ‘Okay, so what are some of the specific strategies I might implement that will move in this direction?’ And then, what do the deliverables look like at the end. **You have to think about this as a strategic planning process.**

> This is part of the conversation that's happening out there right now is there’s this expectation that by using this crowdsourcing technology or processes that it will make it easier for you to do things and I think what we realize is though, it doesn't actually make things easier, it just facilitates a type of greater engagement of many people working on a common project. So collective action.”
